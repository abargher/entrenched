# Gameplay Implementation:

- 2D sidescroller/runner
- Must pick one of three dialogue choices, which then is executed by a command:
- action command/ wario-ware style mini 'games' (inputs) to execute sending
the command
- Two things happening: stability and action commands
- add difficulty: closer keyboard messups

- Detective game movie
- 

# Game summary:
- Two 6 year olds are in a trenchcoat, posing as 12
- 12 year old pairs up with fake 12 year old to be 24 (in a trenchcoat)
- They all want to go to the PG-13 movie based on their favorite detective
video game.
- They team up, but 12 year old doesn't know that 6 year olds are two 6 year
olds.
- Sidescrolling (left to right) infinite runner game
- Game has two modes: Story mode and Endless mode
  - Story mode has intro and ending cutscene/comic
  (game ends at a certain distance, showing movie cutscene)
  - endless mode is the same gameplay, with no ending

# Story mode potential:
- Game begins as 6 year olds, same game (but 2 thought bubble choices)
- Then partway through, they meet the 12 year old, both recognize each other's
idea, then decide to team up
